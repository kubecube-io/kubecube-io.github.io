## Previewing your changes on a local website server

If you'd like to preview your doc updates as you work, you can install Hugo and run a local server to host your website. This section shows you how.

### Install Hugo and other dependencies

You need Hugo version 0.81or later, and it must be the **extended** version of Hugo. 

To get the latest extended version of Hugo:

1. Go to the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) page.
2. In the most recent release, scroll down until you find a list of **extended** versions.
3. Download the relevant file for your operating system.
4. Unzip the downloaded file into a location of your choice.

For more details about installing Hugo, See the [Hugo installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

**Not Necessary:**If you plan to make changes to the site styling, you need to install some **CSS libraries** as well. Follow the instructions in the [Docsy theme's setup guide](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#install-postcss).

### Run a local website server

1. Fork this repository and clone it

	```
	$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kubecube-io/kubecube-io.github.io.git
	$ cd kubecube-io.github.io
	```
	
2. Start your website server. Make sure you run this command from the `kubecube-io.github.io` directory, so that Hugo can find the config files it needs:

   ```
   hugo server
   ```

3. You can access your website at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
