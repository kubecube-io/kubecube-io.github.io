Welcome to KubeCube community! If you are looking for information on how to join us, you are in the right place. We encourage you to help out by reporting issues, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or adding new features. Every contribution is precious for KubeCube.

## Reporting issues
To be honest, we regard every user of KubeCube as a very kind contributor. After experiencing KubeCube, you may have some feedback for the project. Then feel free to open an issue.

There are lot of cases when you could open an issue:

- bug report
- feature request
- performance issues
- feature proposal
- feature design
- help wanted
- doc incomplete
- test improvement
- any questions on project
- ...

Also we must remind that when filing a new issue, please remember to remove the sensitive data from your post. Sensitive data could be password, secret key, network locations, private business data and so on.

## Contribution

To put forward a PR, we assume you have registered a GitHub ID. Then you could finish the preparation in the following steps:

1. Fork the repository you wish to work on. You just need to click the button Fork in right-left of project repository main page. Then you will end up with your repository in your GitHub username.
2. Clone your own repository to develop locally. Use git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project>.git to clone repository to your local machine. Then you can create new branches to finish the change you wish to make.
3. Set remote upstream to be https://github.com/kubecube-io/<project>.git using the following two commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubecube-io/<project>.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no-pushing
```

Adding this, we can easily synchronize local branches with upstream branches.

4. **Create a branch** to add a new feature or fix issues

Update local working directory:

```bash
cd <project>
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

Make any change on the new-branch then build and test your codes.

### PR Description

We encourage contributors to follow the [PR template](https://github.com/kubecube-io/kubecube/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to finish the pull request.
